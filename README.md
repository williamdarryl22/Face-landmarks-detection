# 🧠 Face Landmark Detection – iBUG 300-W Dataset

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates facial landmark detection using the [iBUG 300-W dataset](http://dlib.net/files/data/ibug_300W_large_face_landmark_dataset.tar.gz). The aim is to detect and visualize key facial points (eyes, nose, mouth, jawline) on human faces using classical computer vision techniques. The application of such models spans across facial recognition, emotion detection, medical imaging, and augmented reality.

Implemented in **Python** using **Dlib** and **OpenCV**, this project runs entirely in **Google Colab**.
